# Rental-House-Market-Analysis

I am creating a code to look through different neighborhoods throughout San Fransisco, and identify the best areas for investments based on previous financial trends. I will be displaying these results using hvplots to give the user an interactive and visual way to view the best neighborhoods for investments.

## Technologies

In this code, I used Python, Hvplot, and Pandas.

## Installation

import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from pathlib import Path

## Usage 

I created a GEO plot and other dataframes to store the data from the csv files I imported. This allows for the viewer to easily see and click through neighborhoods to get a representation of the trends plotted.

## Contributors

I was the main contributor for this project!
